# **Fetal Programming of the Newborn and Infant Human Brain**

**Collection ID:** 1890

---

### **Project Overview**

This project proposes a **prospective, longitudinal follow-up study** in a **population-based cohort of children** born to mothers participating in an **NIH-funded study of biological and behavioral processes in pregnancy**.

Researchers will conduct **extensive characterization of this child cohort** throughout their **intrauterine life and birth**. The prenatal measures include **serial assessments of the maternal-placental-fetal endocrine and immune/inflammatory environment**, essential for understanding how **intrauterine exposures influence newborn and infant brain development**.

### **Research Goals**

* To determine how prenatal environmental factors shape early brain development in infants.
* To better understand the **biological pathways** linking prenatal environments to **neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders** later in life.

# **2/3-Social Processes Initiative in Neurobiology of the Schizophrenia(s)**
**Collection ID:** 2098

---

### **Project Overview**

**Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSDs)**, including **schizophrenia**, **schizoaffective disorder**, and **schizophreniform disorder**, are characterized by a continuum of **social functioning impairments** that often persist despite treatment.

This project, leveraging consistent pilot data across three sites, aims to **comprehensively delineate the neurobiology of social cognitive (SCog) process impairment in SSDs** using the **Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)** investigational framework.

---

### **Research Approach**

The project will employ advanced **structural and functional neuroimaging** to investigate **neural circuitry involved in SCog processes**, moving from healthy controls to individuals with SSDs.

**Key Neuroimaging and Analysis Methods:**

1. **Gray Matter Morphology:**

   * Map cortical thickness and analyze **network topology**.
2. **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI):**

   * Examine white matter circuits.
3. **Functional MRI (fMRI):**

   * Use both **resting-state** and **task-based** fMRI to measure circuit function.
4. **Multivariate Neuroimaging Analysis:**

   * Apply **Partial Least Squares (PLS)** to relate **brain structure, function, and behavior** across participants.

**Matrix of Analysis:**

* This RDoC-based approach will map **SCog process constructs** across the entire schizophrenia spectrum, from normal controls to those with SSDs.

### **Study Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:**
  Identify **abnormal brain-behavior relationships** in social cognitive processes, starting at the circuit level.

* **Long-Term Goal:**
  Discover **new therapeutic targets** for the treatment of social impairments in SSDs by identifying the underlying **neural circuitry and pathophysiology**.

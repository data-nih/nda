# **Integrity and Dynamic Processing Efficiency of Networks in ASD**
**Collection ID:** 2285

---

### **Project Overview**

Emerging evidence from **functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI)** and **diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)** studies suggests that **cognitive**, **socio-communicative**, and **sensorimotor** impairments in **autism spectrum disorders (ASD)** are linked to **abnormal brain network connectivity**. However, most studies have yet to integrate **functional and anatomical connectivity measures**—let alone dynamic processing metrics using **magnetoencephalography (MEG)**.

This project aims to fill this gap by **combining fcMRI, DTI, and MEG** to comprehensively investigate network integrity and processing dynamics in ASD.

### **Study Design**

* **Participants:**

  * **60 adolescents with ASD**
  * **60 matched typically developing (TD) participants**

* **Imaging and Analysis Approaches:**

  * **fMRI (functional connectivity):**

    * During **lexical-semantic decision tasks** to identify key nodes of a **Visual, Lexico-Semantic, Executive, and Motor (VLSEM)** circuit.
    * Examine both **within-circuit** and **whole-brain connectivity**.
  * **DTI:**

    * Measure structural connectivity between VLSEM circuit nodes.
  * **MEG:**

    * Assess **dynamic processing efficiency** and real-time network dynamics within these circuits.

---

### **Study Objectives**

1. **Identify VLSEM Circuit Nodes:**

   * Using fMRI data during lexical-semantic decision tasks.
2. **Characterize Connectivity:**

   * Map functional and anatomical connectivity within VLSEM circuits and with the broader brain.
3. **Evaluate Dynamic Processing:**

   * Use MEG to assess **temporal aspects of network engagement**.
4. **Integrate Multi-Modal Data:**

   * Provide a holistic understanding of how **circuit-level abnormalities** contribute to ASD symptoms.

### **Significance**

By integrating **structural, functional, and dynamic neural measures**, this project will:

* Advance our understanding of **neural network dysfunction** in ASD.
* Highlight potential **targets for early intervention** to address cognitive and socio-communicative challenges.

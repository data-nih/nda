### **Effects of Poverty on Affective Development: A Multi-Level, Longitudinal Study**

**Collection ID:** 2106

---

### **Project Overview**

**Poverty** affects **1 in 5 children in the US**, increasing the risk of **lifelong psychopathology** that perpetuates low socioeconomic status. Poverty-related stressors can biologically embed themselves in a child’s development, altering **brain function** and the **hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis**, thereby predisposing to **anxiety and depression**.

This project aims to elucidate how **chronic poverty-related stress** impacts biological mechanisms and ultimately **increases psychopathology risk**.

### **Key Research Questions**

* How do **exposure to danger**, **family conflict**, **residential instability**, and **neglect** impact:

  * **HPA axis regulation**
  * **Amygdala reactivity**
  * **Regulatory connections** from the **ventromedial prefrontal cortex** to the amygdala
* How do these stressors shape a **heightened sensitivity to negative events** and contribute to **anxiety and depression symptoms**?

### **Study Design**

* **Participants:**

  * Teens from the **Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS)**, a nationally representative sample of children born to predominantly low-income families.
  * Longitudinal data from birth to **age 15**, with follow-up at **age 17**.

* **Assessments at Age 15:**

  * **Functional MRI (fMRI):**

    * Activation and connectivity in response to **emotional faces**
  * **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI):**

    * Structural connectivity
  * **HPA Axis Measures:**

    * **Cortisol** and **DHEA** responses to stress
  * **Behavioral Measures:**

    * Attention bias
  * **Self- and Parent-Report:**

    * Negative affect, anxiety, and depression symptoms

* **Integration:**

  * Developmental history from FFCWS (economic status, parenting, early symptoms) mapped onto **neurobiological and psychological outcomes**.

### **Significance**

This study will:

* Advance understanding of the **biological embedding of poverty** and its **neurodevelopmental consequences**.
* Identify **critical pathways** linking poverty to psychopathology.
* Inform **targeted interventions** to break cycles of adversity and poor mental health outcomes.

### **Mechanisms Underlying Resilience to Neighborhood Disadvantage**

**Collection ID:** 2818

---

### **Project Overview**

While **neighborhood disadvantage** has long been associated with negative **physical, socioeconomic, and mental health outcomes**, many children growing up in such contexts exhibit **remarkable adaptive competence**. This project seeks to identify the **neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental pathways** through which **familial and community-level protective factors** support these resilient outcomes.

### **Study Design**

* **Participants:**

  * **500 adolescent twin pairs (ages 11–16)**
  * Previously assessed at **ages 6–10**
  * Residing in **modestly-to-severely disadvantaged neighborhoods**

* **Neuroimaging:**

  * **Joint models** that integrate:

    * **Task-based fMRI**
    * **Resting-state fMRI**
    * **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)**
    * **Structural MRI (sMRI)**

* **Key Constructs:**

  * **Resilience:** Defined as **adaptive competence** and **absence of psychopathology**
  * **Protective processes:** Familial and community-level supports

### **Research Objectives**

1. **Identify neural markers of resilience**

   * Determine which **synergistic neural networks** are linked to adaptive outcomes in the face of disadvantage.
2. **Illuminate multilevel pathways**

   * Leverage the **longitudinal and genetically-informed twin sample** to explore **epigenetic, environmental, and genetic influences** on resilience.
3. **Understand protective processes**

   * Test the hypothesis that **positive parenting and community factors** foster **normative neural architecture** in children exposed to adversity, enabling them to thrive.

### **Significance**

This **genetically-informed developmental neuroscience** approach aims to:

* Reveal **multilevel biobehavioral pathways** that promote resilience to adversity.
* Advance **preventive and early intervention strategies** for children in disadvantaged environments.
* Deepen our understanding of **how brain development supports resilience** in the face of chronic neighborhood disadvantage.

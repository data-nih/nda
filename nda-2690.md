# **Integration of Neural Networks and Attachment in Human Infants**
**Collection ID:** 2690

---

### **Project Overview**

Early life stress and variations in **caregiving**—particularly insecure or disorganized attachment—are known risk factors for **behavioral and emotional maladaptation** in childhood. Yet, **neurobiological mechanisms** linking early caregiving, attachment security, and brain development in infancy remain poorly understood.

This project uses **resting-state fMRI** and **diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)** to investigate how the **integration of neural networks** during the first year of life varies as a function of **maternal caregiving** and how these neural changes relate to **attachment security at 12 months**.

### **Study Design**

* **Longitudinal Assessments:**

  * Infant brain scans at **3 and 12 months** during natural sleep (resting-state fMRI and DTI).
  * Infant-mother interactions at **3, 6, and 9 months**:

    * Traditional interaction paradigms.
    * **New technology** for naturalistic home environment capture using an **automated system**.
  * Infant-mother attachment assessed at **12 months** using the **Strange Situation Procedure** (gold standard for attachment measurement).

* **Neural Network Analysis:**

  * **Intra-network and inter-network connectivity**.
  * **Dynamic, whole-brain, data-driven approaches** to capture changes in functional and structural brain networks.

### **Significance**

By integrating **multiple levels of analysis across multiple time points**, this project aims to:

* Uncover **transactions** among maternal caregiving, infant behavior, and brain network development.
* Provide **conceptual advances** in understanding how early caregiving shapes trajectories of brain and behavioral development.
* Identify **potential targets for early preventive interventions** to promote healthy socio-emotional and neural development.

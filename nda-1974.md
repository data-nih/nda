### **Early Brain Development in Twins**

**Collection ID:** 1974

---

### **Project Overview**

**Twin studies** have been essential for determining the roles of **genetic and environmental factors** in brain development and for understanding abnormalities underlying **neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders**.

While twin studies in older children and adults have shown strong genetic contributions to **total brain volume**, **total gray matter**, and **total white matter volumes**, studies of early childhood brain development in twins have been scarce—until now.

### **Current Findings**

* Using **prenatal ultrasound** and **neonatal MRI**, the study examined **discordance of early brain development** in **over 100 twin pairs**.
* **Key discoveries:**

  * Prenatal brain size discordance in **monozygotic (MZ)** and **dizygotic (DZ)** twins is similar.
  * By **1 month after birth**, MZ twins show **less discordance** in overall brain volume compared to DZ twins.
  * **Statistical modeling** shows **global tissue volumes** in neonates are **highly heritable**, consistent with findings in older children and adults.
  * **Gray matter heritability** is slightly lower in neonates than in older individuals.
  * **Gray matter density correlations** decrease in the first year of life, likely reflecting the rapid brain growth during this period.
  * While **global white matter volumes** are highly heritable, **diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) properties** of specific tracts are **not highly heritable**.

### **Next Phase of Research**

In the next funding cycle, the study will:

* **Expand the cohort** by recruiting additional twin pairs.
* **Follow participants through age 6** with:

  * Structural MRI
  * DTI
  * Developmental assessments

**Goal:** To pinpoint how **genetic and environmental factors** shape brain development during the first years of life—crucial for understanding early origins of psychiatric disorders.

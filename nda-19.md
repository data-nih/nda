# **Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism**

**Collection ID:** 19

---

### **Project Overview**

This dataset was generated by the **IBIS Autism Project**, part of the **Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE) Network**, which is a collaborative effort involving:

* **University of North Carolina (UNC)**
* **University of Washington (UW)**
* **Washington University (WU)**
* **Yale University**
* **Data Coordinating Center (DCC)** at the **Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)**

The study involves a **longitudinal MRI/DTI and behavioral assessment** of infants at **high risk for autism** (siblings of autistic individuals) at **6, 12, and 24 months of age**.

---

### **Goals**

The project aims to understand how early brain development may differ in infants who are at increased genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). By examining structural and connectivity changes in the developing brain, researchers hope to identify **biomarkers for early detection** and potentially inform **early intervention strategies**.

# **Multimodal Developmental Neurogenetics of Females with ASD**
**Collection ID:** 2021

---

### **Project Overview**

**Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)** are known for their **remarkable heterogeneity** at both the **phenotypic** and **genetic** levels. Notably, ASD disproportionately affects **males** relative to **females**, yet the reasons for this disparity remain elusive due to limited phenotyping and small sample sizes in past studies.

This project seeks to bridge this gap by leveraging an **interdisciplinary network** to deeply **phenotype and genotype a sex-balanced cohort**, aiming to uncover **sex-specific neurobiological and genetic factors** in ASD.

### **Study Design**

* **Cohort:**

  * **ASD participants:** 125
  * **Typically developing (TD) controls:** 125
  * **Unaffected siblings** also included

* **Data Collected:**

  * Behavioral phenotyping across multiple domains
  * **Brain imaging:**

    * Structural MRI (**sMRI**)
    * Diffusion Tensor Imaging (**DTI**)
    * Functional MRI (**fMRI**; task-based and resting-state)
    * Electroencephalography (**EEG**)
  * **Genetic data:**

    * Copy Number Variation (**CNV**)
    * Single Nucleotide Variation (**SNV**)
    * Parental genotyping for familial analyses

---

### **Research Objectives**

1. **Identify Sex Differences**

   * In brain structure, function, connectivity, and temporal dynamics in ASD.

2. **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**

   * Assess how CNVs and SNVs relate to brain structure and function in ASD versus TD.

3. **Relate Brain and Genetic Differences to ASD Heterogeneity**

   * Explore how these factors contribute to behavioral variability in ASD.

Advanced **network-based methods (iWGCNA)** will be employed to integrate and analyze these multimodal data across **affected individuals, unaffected siblings, and controls**.

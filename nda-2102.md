# **A Multidimensional Investigation of Cognitive Control Deficits in Psychopathology**

**Collection ID:** 2102

---

### **Project Overview**

**Psychotic spectrum disorders (PSD)**, including **schizophrenia**, **schizoaffective disorder**, and **bipolar disorder with psychotic features**, are often **difficult to diagnose and treat**. Despite traditional diagnostic categories, these disorders share **overlapping symptoms**—particularly **cognitive control/executive functioning deficits**, which arise from **mesocortical and mesostriatal pathway dysregulation**.

These cognitive deficits are **strongly associated with poor social and occupational outcomes** and remain largely **refractory to existing treatments**.

---

### **Research Objectives**

* **Primary Outcome:** Identify **neurophysiologically-based cluster metrics (circuit-level pathologies)** that predict **cognitive control deficits** across PSD diagnoses.
* **Secondary Outcome:** Examine how these neurophysiological profiles correlate with **real-world functioning** and traditional clinical symptoms (e.g., disorganized thinking).
* **Genetic Analyses:**

  * Investigate the aggregation of **SNPs** in key neurotransmitter pathways (**dopamine, glutamate, GABA**) and in **axonal guidance** and **synaptic long-term potentiation** pathways.
  * Explore whether **rare deletions (CNVs)** mediate cognitive control deficits across multiple psychiatric illnesses.

---

### **Study Design**

* **Participants:** 175 continuously recruited PSD patients.

* **Assessments:**

  * Extensive clinical and cognitive battery
  * Multimodal neuroimaging:

    * Functional MRI (evoked and resting state)
    * Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) for white matter integrity and connectivity
  * Multisensory cognitive control task with real-world relevance

* **Analytic Strategy:**

  * Use **univariate and multivariate indices** of grey/white matter pathology within the cognitive control network (dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus).
  * Apply **K-means clustering** to identify meaningful neurobiological subgroups.
  * Assess predictive validity of these clusters for cognitive control and everyday functioning using **leave-one-out cross-validation**.

### **Significance**

By moving beyond traditional diagnostic frameworks and leveraging **NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)**-aligned multi-level analyses (genes, circuits, behaviors, paradigms), this project aims to:

* **Develop a novel classification system** based on **neurophysiological and genetic biomarkers** of impaired cognitive control.
* Inform more precise and effective treatments for **refractory symptoms** in PSD, improving mental health care outcomes.

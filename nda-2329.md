### **Cincinnati MR Imaging of Neurodevelopment (C-MIND)**

**Collection ID:** 2329

---

### **Project Overview**

The **C-MIND dataset** is part of the **Pediatric Functional Neuroimaging Research Network**, a collaboration led by the **Pediatric Neuroimaging Research Consortium** at **Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC)**, with partners including:

* **Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI)** at the University of Southern California
* **Brain Mapping Center** at UCLA
* **Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh**
* **University of Michigan**

This initiative was supported by the **Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)** and aimed to:

1. **Develop standardized recruitment, scanning, and processing protocols** for pediatric neuroimaging across development.
2. **Investigate brain development from infancy through adolescence**.

### **Dataset Composition**

* **Imaging Data:**

  * **T1-weighted (T1-W) and T2-weighted (T2-W) 3D anatomical scans**
  * **BOLD-fMRI**
  * **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)**
  * **Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging**
  * A **novel concurrent ASL/BOLD-fMRI dataset** for exploring **neurovascular coupling** and **BOLD response** relationships

* **Behavioral Data:**

  * Collected in conjunction with imaging to allow investigation of **brain-behavior relationships** during development

* **Cohort Details:**

  * Over **200 typically developing children** for cross-sectional analyses
  * Longitudinal imaging and behavioral data:

    * **40 infants and toddlers (0–3 years)**
    * **30 children (7–9 years)**

### **Research Significance**

The C-MIND dataset enables investigation of:

* **Developmental changes in white and gray matter**
* **Structural and functional connectivity**
* **Neurovascular coupling/reactivity**
* **Relationships between brain development and cognitive changes**

This comprehensive dataset offers unique insights into **normal brain maturation** from infancy through adolescence.

# **Taste Reward Circuits and Prediction Error Define Eating Disorder Psychopathology**

**Collection ID:** 2138

---

### **Project Overview**

**Eating disorders (EDs)** such as **anorexia nervosa (AN)** and **bulimia nervosa (BN)** are severe psychiatric conditions with some of the **highest mortality rates** of any mental illnesses. Despite differences in weight and behavior between AN and BN, both disorders share **core features** like **food restriction, binge eating, and purging**—and little is known about the **biological mechanisms** linking these symptoms to brain function.

This project leverages the **NIMH RDoC framework**, focusing on the **Prediction Error** construct to explore how **brain reward circuitry** underlies dimensions of ED pathology.

### **Research Aims**

1. **Functional Neural Reward Circuits (fMRI)**

   * Examine **taste-reward prediction error responses** in adolescents and young adults (**ages 16–29**), a group at **highest risk** for severe ED outcomes.
   * **Brain regions of interest:**

     * **Anteroventral striatum (caudate/putamen)**
     * **Insula**
     * **Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)**
   * Hypotheses:

     * Lower **BMI** in ED subjects will be linked to **heightened ACC activation** to reward-predicting stimuli.
     * **Prediction error responses** in these circuits will be associated with **ED-relevant behaviors**.

2. **Structural MRI and DTI**

   * Assess **gray and white matter volume** and **white matter integrity**.
   * Hypotheses:

     * Severe ED behaviors will correlate with **lower caudate and insula volumes**.
     * Structural metrics will predict **functional reward circuit activation** from Aim 1.

3. **RDoC-based Clustering**

   * Cluster ED individuals based on **prediction error responses**, contrasting with traditional **DSM criteria**.
   * Hypotheses:

     * Prediction error-based clustering will outperform DSM diagnoses in grouping **ED-relevant behaviors**.
     * Findings will highlight EDs as **disorders of altered salience response**.

### **Significance**

* **Identifies biological underpinnings** of **ED dimensions**, transcending categorical diagnoses.
* Advances **precision psychiatry** by linking **brain-based prediction error signals** to **specific ED behaviors**.
* Informs the **next generation of treatment targets** for EDs based on **reward circuitry vulnerabilities**.

# **Longitudinal Neuroimaging and Neurocognitive Assessment of Risk and Protective Factors Across the Schizophrenia Spectrum**

**Collection ID:** 3445

---

### **Project Overview**

**Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD)** shares similarities with **schizophrenia (SZ)**, but with **attenuated symptoms**, making it a valuable intermediate **SZ-spectrum phenotype**. Investigating SPD provides insights into **etiology, genetics, risk factors, and protective mechanisms** associated with psychosis, without the confounding effects of **antipsychotic medication or hospitalization** often seen in SZ.

This project represents the **first longitudinal study** to:

* Incorporate individuals with SPD into a comprehensive **multimodal neuroimaging and neurocognitive investigation**.
* Leverage the **Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework** to characterize **aberrant neural circuitry** and identify **risk and protective factors** across the SZ spectrum.

---

### **Study Design**

* **Participants:**

  * **Healthy controls (HCs)**: 80 (no Axis I or personality disorders)
  * **SPD (unmedicated, no Axis I disorders)**: 80
  * **Early-onset SZ (first 2 years of illness)**: 80
  * **Age range:** 18–40 years
  * **Timepoints:** Baseline, 9-month, and 18-month follow-ups

* **Multimodal Neuroimaging:**

  * **Structural MRI**
  * **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)**
  * **Resting-state fMRI**
  * **Task-based fMRI** (nonverbal working memory task at baseline and 18 months)

* **Neurocognitive and Clinical Assessments:**

  * Conducted at all three time points

* **Advanced Analytic Methods:**

  * **Dynamic causal modeling (DCM)** to evaluate frontotemporal connectivity hypotheses
  * **Machine learning** to integrate multimodal imaging, neurocognitive, and clinical data

---

### **Research Objectives**

1. **Map the longitudinal course of frontotemporal circuitry abnormalities** across the SZ spectrum.
2. **Track the longitudinal course of neurocognitive, clinical, and functional outcomes** in SZ-spectrum disorders.
3. **Identify factors (or combinations thereof) that differentiate groups** in the SZ spectrum—highlighting risk and protective factors for SZ.

---

### **Significance**

By leveraging **longitudinal and multimodal data**, this project will:

* Clarify **neural mechanisms** that protect SPD individuals from full-blown psychosis.
* Identify **biomarkers of risk and resilience** in SZ-spectrum disorders.
* Advance **precision interventions** for individuals at heightened risk of schizophrenia.
